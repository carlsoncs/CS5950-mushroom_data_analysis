Here is a place for chris to leave notes.


Created R Script called data_setup.R.  It subsets the data into k folds, 
and each fold is placed in a list called "folds".  The folds list can be 
accessed via index, (Index starting at 1).  Each element in the folds list
is a dataframe subset of the mushrooms data, and responds to all the same
variables names as the original subset does.
